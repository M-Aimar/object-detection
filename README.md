## Dataset

**Selection and Justification:** *For this project, we selected the Real Life Industrial Dataset of Casting Product from Kaggle. This dataset is particularly suitable for our task as it contains a vast collection of images of casting products, segmented into two categories: 'defective' and 'ok_front'. The images accurately represent real-life scenarios in industrial manufacturing of metal products, making it an ideal choice for training our AI model to detect manufacturing defects. The dataset's diversity and real-world applicability provide a solid foundation for developing a robust defect detection system.*

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

**Implementation Details:** The dataset was preprocessed to facilitate effective training of our deep learning model. 

Data Visualization: We visualized the dataset to understand the characteristics of both defective and normal samples. This step involved reading sample images from each category and displaying them using matplotlib.

Data Augmentation: To enhance the robustness of our model, we employed ImageDataGenerator from Keras for data augmentation. The images were rescaled, and random transformations like horizontal flip, vertical flip, rotation, and brightness adjustments were applied. This step helps the model generalize better to new, unseen data.

Training and Testing Data Generation: We prepared our data for training and testing using flow_from_directory method. This included setting up directory paths, defining image dimensions (300x300 pixels), and specifying batch sizes. The classes were mapped as 'ok_front': 0 and 'def_front': 1, ensuring a binary classification setup.

Handling Overfitting: To mitigate overfitting, we split our data into training and validation sets, with 40% of the images reserved for validation.

## Feature Extraction

**Using Pre-trained Models:** *We utilized a pre-trained model, ResNet152V2, for feature extraction. This model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is known for its deep architecture and ability to capture complex features, making it an excellent choice for our task. By leveraging transfer learning, we could harness the power of an already established network, fine-tuning it to our specific dataset of casting products.*

## Model Building

**Defect Classification Model:** Our model's architecture was built upon the ResNet152V2 core, with custom layers added on top. The process included:

Layer Configuration: We added a GlobalMaxPooling2D layer followed by a Dense layer with 256 units and 'relu' activation. The final layer was a Dense layer with a single unit and 'sigmoid' activation, suitable for binary classification.

Freezing Base Layers: To preserve the learned features in the ResNet152V2 model, we froze its layers during training.

Compilation and Training: The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. We used accuracy, AUC, Precision, and Recall as metrics. Training was performed for 10 epochs with checkpoints to save the best model based on validation AUC.

Model Evaluation: Post-training, we evaluated the model using a classification report and a confusion matrix, achieving high precision and recall, indicating the model's effectiveness in classifying defects in casting products.

## Cloud Platform Hosting and Dashboard

**Deployment and User Interface:** *For hosting our AI defect detection system and developing the user interface, we chose Streamlit, a powerful platform that excels in creating interactive web applications for data-driven projects. Streamlit's ease of use and seamless integration with Python made it the ideal choice for rapidly deploying our model into a user-friendly web application. It enabled us to create an intuitive dashboard where users can easily upload images for defect classification, view results, and interact with the AI model's output. This choice significantly streamlined our development process, allowing us to focus on optimizing the AI model and ensuring a smooth user experience. The deployment on Streamlit not only enhanced the accessibility of our defect detection system but also ensured scalability and efficient handling of the image processing workload.*

## Task Relevance Filtering

**Image Rejection System:** *Our Streamlit application incorporates a task relevance filtering mechanism to ensure only appropriate metal casting images are processed. This is achieved through a streamlined process: images uploaded by users are preprocessed and passed to our trained AI model. The model predicts if the image shows a defective or normal metal casting. If an inappropriate image is uploaded, the application detects this and prompts the user to upload a relevant metal casting image, ensuring that our system remains focused and effective in defect detection.*
